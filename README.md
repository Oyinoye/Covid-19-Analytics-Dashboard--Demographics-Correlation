# Plotly Dash Dashboard to Analyze the Effects of Demographics in Covid Infections

This project is done in fulflment of a data analytics task to determine correlation between infection rates and certain factors in some key countries. 

For this to be done, additional data must also be included which is why a form page has been included.

The insights page gives insights unique to the task based on dummy data populated to show as a prototype for the specific use case.

I am still working on this project and more updates will seen in the near future.

United States, United Kingdom and South Africa are the the focus of this study because the infection rates among minority groups in these countries seem not to follow the trend.

# Interpreting the Dashboard
The home page shows the comparison between COVID Cases and minority groups among the different focus groups in the case study. The form page is to collect the information that will be necessary to analyze oterh factors such as effets of sex, age etc on the rate of spread.
